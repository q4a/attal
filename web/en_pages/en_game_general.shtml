    - General overview - <br>
    <br>
    The game will be themeable in order to deal with different rules, graphics, 
    scenarii.<br>
    <br>
    Most of the current graphics (see "screenshots") are included in the cyberpunk-theme 
    (the world in a half century).<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    In Attal, you rule Lords (the equivalent of Heroes in HOMM3) and their armies. 
    They will increase their experience in finding artefacts, objects or in fighting 
    other lords. <br>
    <br>
    You will have (also) to manage bases and towns that you can develop (in order 
    to produce more or better units, and so on), use mines or factories (which 
    provide ressources) to produce other structures...<br>
    <br>
    In each game, you will have a mission to achieve but you could also find other 
    sub-missions during the game.<br>
    <br>
    <u>- The World of Attal </u><br>
    <br>
    The world of attal will change with the theme used and so for Lords, units, 
    bases, ...<br>
    <br>
    <u>- Attal, yet another strategy game ?</u><br>
    <br>
    Yes, we will (of course) use good ideas of other strategy game like HOMM 3. 
    But our goal is to make a really unique game, with our own rules and story 
    even if, at the beginning, Attal could be very close of HOMM3.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    We will use our own graphics, drawn in 3D.<br>
    <br>
    We are working on an original scenario that will be (at least we hope so) 
    captivating. <br>
    Rules will be easy to change and to adapt. <br>
    We hope you will help us for this project... <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    As we said before, all this modifications won't be possible at first but we 
    will evolve towards them.<br>
    <br>
    If you want to join us for developping them, do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:attal@fr.st">join
