  	The FAQ answers all the questions you could have about Attal (development, graphics, scenarii, themes...).<br>
	<ul>
	<li>How playing with new themes ?
	  <blockquote>
	    If you want to play with a new theme, you just have to add the '-theme' option when you start Attal (followed by a theme name).
	    For the moment, there is only two themes : 'medieval' and 'cyberpunk'.
	  </blockquote>
	<li>Why graphics of the 'medieval' theme are so ugly ?
	  <blockquote>
	    Attal's graphists are only focused (for the moment) on the cyberpunk theme (it takes all their time and energy). 
	    The 'medieval' theme is quickly developped in parallel in order to show you another theme but we can't spend time for it. 
	    If you are interested by developping it, we will welcome your contribution.
	  </blockquote>
	  <li>I can't compile Attal ! What to do ?
	<blockquote>	 
	    Read INSTALL file !! If it's not enough, <a href="mailto:paudoux@chez.com">contact me</a>.
	</blockquote>
	<li>Will Attal be available under Windows ?
	<blockquote>
		Well, the sources are in C++, so totally portable. But they
use a library : Qt. This one is also available under Windows environment but
is not free. As we can't afford it for the moment, there is no Win version,
but who knows, one day...
