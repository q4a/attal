  Attal is developped under Linux environment. <br>
	Sources are written in C++ (using Qt 2.2 libraries).<br>

	Note : Qt is released under GPL and you can download it from : 
	<a href="ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source/">ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source/ </a>
	  <br>
	If you want to know the development steps, look at our
	  <a href="roadmap_en.htm">roadmap</a><br>
	<br>
 You can also browse the CVS on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/attal/">Attal's project site
    </a> (hosted by Sourceforge) in order to be up-to-date with the evolutions of Attal. </p>

	Shortview of the sources.<br>
      <br>
      We will trying here to give a quick shortview of sources in order to help new developers to join us.<br>
      There is a few folders in the source :
	<ul>
	<li><b>client</b> : code specific for the client (GUI, ...).
	<li><b>server</b> : code specific for the server (GUI, game engine, ...).
	<li><b>common</b> : code in common for the client and the server (network, game structures like map, lords...).
	<li><b>ia</b> : code managing the ai, both for the fight phase (this code is also used by the server when someone
		fights against creatures which are not owned by any player) and the adventure phase.
	<li><b>editor</b> : code specific for the map editor.
	<li><b>themes</b> : only data files (and pics) for the theme management.
	</ul>
      <br><br>
      Theme management<br><br>
      The theme management is one of the most important feature of Attal : it will allow to create totally different games (different graphics, different rules...).
      Information and data which are theme-specific have to be in the 'themes' directory, where each sub-directory defines a new theme.
      The name of the sub-directory will be the name of the theme (for example 'cyberpunk').
      In these sub-directories are other folders :<br>
      'data', where rules are defined and 'images' where are graphics. There could be more folders (for example for the sound...)
      Theses folders ('data', 'images', ...) could be divided with other sub-folders
      There is one file, 'description.txt', in the '/themes' directory. It
describes the files that should be in the 'data' sub-directory, their role and
the format of the data inside.
