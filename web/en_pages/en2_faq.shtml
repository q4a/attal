    The FAQ answers all the questions you could have about Attal (development, 
    graphics, scenarii, themes...).<br>
  <ul>
    <li>How playing with new themes ? 
      <blockquote> If you want to play with a new theme, you just have to add 
        the '-theme' option when you start Attal (followed by a theme name). For 
        the moment, there is only two themes : 'medieval' and 'cyberpunk'. </blockquote>
    <li>Why graphics of the 'medieval' theme are so ugly ? 
      <blockquote> Attal's graphists are only focused (for the moment) on the 
        cyberpunk theme (it takes all their time and energy). The 'medieval' theme 
        is quickly developped in parallel in order to show you another theme but 
        we can't spend time for it. If you are interested by developping it, we 
        will welcome your contribution. </blockquote>
    <li>I can't compile Attal ! What to do ? Read INSTALL file !! If it's not 
      enough, <a href="mailto:paudoux@chez.com">contact me</a>.
