    - Attal is a project of turn-based strategy game. <br>
    Rules will be inspired of a famous game created by 3DO : "Heroes of Might 
    and Magic III". You can play in stand-alone mode (against AI) or against other 
    human player through a network. <br>
    This game will be open and themeable, in order to allow new graphics, new 
    rules, new campaigns and new scenarii. We will even provide a map editor and 
    a scenario's editor. <br>
    <br>
    Current graphics (created by our team) are included in the "Cyberpunk" theme. 
    We plan to develop (later) another theme "medieval" (with adapted rules).<br>
    <br>
    - We want to achieve a complete, open and high quality game : <br>
    <br>
    <i>Complete</i> -> We don't want to just develop a game engine but a real 
    game, fully playable, with tested rules. It will be possible to play in solo 
    or multiplayer mode, with campaigns, editor... <br>
    <i>Open</i> -> Developped in "Open Source", le goal of Attal is not to earn 
    money (sniff...) but to show that it is possible to make good game, free and 
    open. <br>
    <i>High Quality</i> -> We want to realize a game that could be compared with 
    commercial one. (but, of course, we will try to do it better) <br>
    <br>
    This (great) projetct is quite new (august 2000) but we have clear ideas on 
    what to do and how. (look at our Roadmap). <br>
    <br>
    The team is currently composed of 5 (motivated) people... but we will welcome 
    other members.<br>
    We invite you to look at these pages and if you are interested in one part 
    of it (development, graphics, sound, music, scenario...), please <a href="mailto:attal-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">contact 
    us</a>. <br>
    <br>
    Look at our <a href="roadmap_en.htm">roadmap</a> for coming developments.
