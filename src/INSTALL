We are now  using automake/autoconf, so do the following steps :

$ make -f Makefile.dist	--> generate 'configure' script
$ ./configure		--> generate makefiles
$ make			--> compile/link the sources

Well, evrything should be ok now.
You can launch :
	- the client:
		$ ./client/attal-client &
	- the server:
		$ ./server/attal-server &
	- the ia-client:
		$ ./ia/attal-ia &
	- the scenario editor:
		$ ./scenarioEditor/scenario-editor &
	- the theme editor:
		$ ./themeEditor/theme-editor &

If you want to change theme, use the option '-theme themename' with server & clients

* More details
If you don't manage to run Attal with this explanations, here are more :

Be sure that you have Qt 2.2 (at least) (we currently developp with qt 2.3.2).
If not, download it on the www.trolltech.com website (see direct url on out
website), then compile it (read their INSTALL file !).
You don't need to install it.
Let's suppose that you have downloaded and compiled in /opt/be/qt2

Now go in the directory where are Attal's sources.
Then type (using bash):
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/be/qt2/lib 
(you should add this line in your .profile, because you will need that the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable be set to this value each time you will run Attal).
$ make -f Makefile.dist
$ ./configure --with-qt-dir=/opt/be/qt2
$ make

It should work !
