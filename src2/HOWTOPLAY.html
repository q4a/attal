website (<A HREF="http://www.attal-thegame.org/">www.attal-thegame.org</A>

</UL>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="chII2"></A>2) Turn-by-turn game</H4>
<P>Attal is a turn by turn game, so you play only when it is your
turn to. There is no time limitation for the moment. Only some
scenario could require it. When it is not your turn to play, you can
only chat with other player or, if you are attacked by another
player, defend yourself (in fight mode). 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="chII3"></A>3) Managing lords</H4>
<P>You can select a lord through the list of lords or on clicking on
it in the main view. Then you can make it move in clicking elsewhere
on the map (you will see first a path on the ground and if you click
again the lord will move).<BR>If you click twice on a lord (on the
map or in the list), you can see the characteristics of the lord (and
change his artefacts, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">his
</SPAN>units...).<BR>If two 'friend' lords encounter, you can do some
exchange between them (units, artefacts...) but if they are opponent,
they fight! (see (<A HREF="#chII6">6 - Fight mode</A>)) 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="chII4"></A>4) Managing bases</H4>
<P>You can select a base through the list of bases or on clicking on
it in the main view. If you click twice on a base (on the map or in
the list), you can see the inside of the base and act inside (add new
buildings, buy units, trade in the market).</P>
<P>You have some different building actions implemented:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.1cm">Main building: you can buy other
	buildings</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.1cm">Market: where you can trade your
	resources</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.1cm">Lord's building: buy lords</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.1cm">Castle: a complete list of all
	units available</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.1cm">Various building where you can
	buy units</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.1cm; background: transparent"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.1cm; background: transparent">New units
are produced every monday (but it will be customizable), replacing
old units available.<BR>When you buy an unit, it will be placed on
the unit window (click on lord face (or no lord face) to activate
this window). 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.1cm; background: transparent">They are two
lord status in a base: visitor and garrison: it is possible to have
two lords in a base, one garrison and another visitor: it is possible
to defend a base only if a garrison lord is present, otherwise all
units produced are lost.</P>
<P>To set a lord garrison is necessary to place lord face on the base
name in unit window.</P>
<P><A NAME="chII5"></A><B>5) Economic</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">The economic
part in Attal is quite complex: you have to manage bases, buildings,
lord and units. All internals buildings and units can have a
maintenance cost that is paid every week.<BR>The external building
can produce a fixed number of resource or one random number between
two ranges, zero and the coeff of ressource.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent">The external
buildings can give other bonus or increment your population.<BR>Every
base have a population: the population growth every week by a ratio
that based on base type. Every base lose population every time the
base change owner by a percentage value based on base type.<BR>The
money (gold) give by to you is equal to your total population plus
the money earned by some particular buildings like gold mines, so
take care to defend the most populated bases. Every base can have a
market and these prices depend on type of base, so different players
have different strategies about resources.<BR>The prices of resources
depend on type of base you own: you pay the best prices for resources
if you own bases of different races.<BR>All these proprieties are
theme-dependant, so you can see that in theme-editor. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="chII6"></A>6) Fight mode</H4>
<P>When two opponent lords encounter, or if a lord attacks a creature
stack on the map, the game enter in fight mode. It is a turn-by-turn
fight, where you can move each lord's units on the ground.</P>
<P>To hit a unit you have to click on enemy unit ( not enemy cell )
and it appear a cursor with an hand-form. A forbidden cursor mean
that is not possible to perform an action on this cell.<BR>A current
unit is automatically selected and has to be played. When the player
who owns it has finished (make it move, or fight a neighbor unit...)
the next unit is selected and so on.. The fight have an end when a
lord lose all his units or when he flees. Then, the winner gain some
experience and the game returns in adventure mode, as usual. 
</P>
<P>In fight mode they are some buttons on bottom left of interface:
the feature currently implemented are flee ( the lord lose the fight
), wait ( pass unit turn ) and option.</P>
<P>In option dialog you can set three params: see/hide cells,
animation active/not active, animations speed.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="chII7"></A>7) End of the game</H4>
<P>If a player complete a quest or defeat all enemies he win. If a
player don't complete the quest ( ex: time exhausted ) or lose all
its lords and bases, he has lost the game.

based on various elements.</P>
<P>You can load a map ( a scenario .scn extension or a saved map .gam

<P>( TODO)</P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="chIII2"></A>2) Theme Editor</H4>
<P>Attal is a themeable game: you can customize most part of the
game: you can change parameters and even properties of single
building.</P>
